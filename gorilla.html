<p class="intro1">Cross River gorilla could be extinct if everyone does not come on board to protect the species, found only in the Nigeria-Cameroon border region, in the Guinean Forests of West Africa HotspotWith only about 300 individuals remaining in the wild, conservationists have expressed concern that the critically endangered Cross River gorilla could be extinct if everyone does not come on board to protect the species, found only in the Nigeria-Cameroon border region, in the Guinean Forests of West Africa Hotspot.

"There are some rare and iconic species that we should give everything to protect; one of these is the Cross River Gorilla. I would not want my grandchildren to be told fairy tales of the Cross River gorilla,” said Ruth Akagu, Nigeria-based project officer of the BirdLife/Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund’s (CEPF) Regional Implementation Team (RIT) in the West Africa biodiversity hotspot.
The Cross River gorilla, Gorilla gorilla diehli is the most endangered of the African apes and was listed as critically endangered in 2013 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).The species has been under pressure from poaching and loss of habitat due to human encroachment; that has fragmented forests, reduced connectivity between several sites and isolated the species, thus reducing gene flow.

According to experts, the Cross River Gorilla is a unique subspecies and the most western and northern form of gorilla. Cross River gorillas are more terrestrial in lifestyle and differ from other lowland gorillas in their physical appearance, their diet and culture..”.</p>

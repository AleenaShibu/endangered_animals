 The Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) is now critically endangered, with populations in sharp decline due to habitat destruction and illegal hunting, the IUCN declared last week.

Bornean orangutans live only on the island of Borneo, where their populations have declined by 60 percent since 1950. New projections anticipate their numbers will fall another 22 percent by the year 2025 to an estimated 47,000 apes.

“This is the first time in many decades that we have a clear understanding of Bornean orangutan population trends,” Erik Meijaard, a member of the IUCN SSC Primates Specialist Group, said in a prepared release. “As orangutans are hunted and pushed out of their habitats, losses to this slow-breeding species are enormous and will be extremely difficult to reverse.”
